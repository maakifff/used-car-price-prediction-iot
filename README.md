# Used Car Price Prediction Project

## 1. Problem Statement
We want to **predict selling price** for **used car market listings**, because it impacts **profit margin**.

We will use data from **historical sales datasets** at **individual car level**. Success looks like **95% accuracy**.

**Key Constraints:** Latency.

## 2. Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate used car prices effectively. The solution will be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance as required by the course guidelines.

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting Skoda car prices using historical vehicle data. The dataset is loaded from the `data/raw/skoda.csv` file and processed within the source code located in the `src` directory. To run the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and execute the main Python script from the `src` folder using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or directly via the terminal. Make sure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed and the correct interpreter is selected in Visual Studio Code. After running the script, the trained model generates price predictions based on the input features. The project also includes a dashboard that allows users to visualize the data and prediction results, which can be accessed through the provided dashboard link (e.g., `http://localhost:XXXX`) after the application is running.
